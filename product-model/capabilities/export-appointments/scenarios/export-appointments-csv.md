# Export expanded dates to CSV

## Trigger

The User chooses whole-calendar or date-range scope and a destination file.

## Outcome

The file contains one Outlook-column row per expanded date, with category assignments. All-day end dates are inclusive; attendees and recurrence rules are not CSV columns.
